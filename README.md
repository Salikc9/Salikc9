- 👋 Hi, I’m @Salikc9
- 👀 I’m interested in changing the trading card game FOREVER. My goal is democratize the ownership of rare, desirable cards. 
- 👾 I’m currently collecting original 151 pokemon cards, Toronto (home) basketball and baseball cards, and undervalued Canadian athletes. I also collect my favourite players from my childhood (Allen Iverson, Vince Carter, Kevin Garnett).
- 🦁 I’m looking to collaborate on anything in the web3.0 space that is inclusive, accessible, and ground-breaking.
